# About
This repository contains the associated code and data necessary to reproduce the results of our systematic review of LLMs in clinical medicine. Additionally, this notebook can be modified and built upon to conduct your own systematic review as well!

`screening.ipynb` contains the code that both runs the LLM screening process and analyzes the results against human ground truth data.

`analysis-and-figures.ipynb` contains the code that produces all of the analysis and figures after the screening has been conducted.

`standalone-web/` contains the HTML/JS/CSS code that allows you to directly browse the generated data. No extra installation or libraries are needed here; just double-click `click_me.html` to launch!

Please reach out if you have any questions or comments!
